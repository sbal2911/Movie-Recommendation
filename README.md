**Movie Recommendation**

**A short project on Movie Recommendation System**

The project involves building a recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset, which includes user ratings, 
movie metadata, and demographic info. It starts with data cleaning and merging, followed by two main recommendation approaches: 
user-item collaborative filtering using similarity measures like cosine similarity and a graph-based model inspired by Netflixâ€™s Pixie algorithm. 
The graph method is implemented manually using adjacency lists and weighted random walks. The project emphasizes practical skills in data preprocessing, 
algorithm development, and understanding scalable recommendation techniques.
